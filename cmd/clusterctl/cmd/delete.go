		clusterctl delete aws
 
		# Deletes the instance of the AWS provider hosted in the "foo" namespace
		# Please note, if there are multiple instances of the AWS provider installed in the cluster,
		# global/shared resources (e.g. ClusterRoles), are not deleted in order to preserve
		# the functioning of the remaining instances.
		clusterctl delete aws --namespace=foo

		# Deletes all the providers
		# Important! As a consequence of this operation, all the corresponding resources managed by
		# Cluster API Providers are orphaned and there might be ongoing costs incurred as a result of this.
		clusterctl delete --all

		# Delete the AWS provider and related CRDs. Please note that this forces deletion of 
		# all the related objects (e.g. AWSClusters, AWSMachines etc.).
		# Important! As a consequence of this operation, all the corresponding resources managed by
		# the AWS infrastructure provider are orphaned and there might be ongoing costs incurred as a result of this.
		clusterctl delete aws --delete-crd

		# Delete the AWS provider and its hosting Namespace. Please note that this forces deletion of 
		# all objects existing in the namespace. 
		# Important! As a consequence of this operation, all the corresponding resources managed by
		# Cluster API Providers are orphaned and there might be ongoing costs incurred as a result of this.
		clusterctl delete aws --delete-namespace

		# Reset the management cluster to its original state
		# Important! As a consequence of this operation all the corresponding resources on target clouds
		# are "orphaned" and thus there may be ongoing costs incurred as a result of this.
